# Recovery Kit 2 Update: (Shargeek 140 Battery)

This is a quick update- I've included below the design file updates for the Recovery Kit 2B which uses the smaller battery. The Raspberry Pi 5 is still too hungry for this smaller battery, so this build is better for a Pi3 or Pi4. The original Recovery Kit 2 battery is now discontinued, but with a tweak to the ends on the battery enclosure ends, you can use the newer [Shargeek 140](https://amzn.to/443Ez7k). Check out the original link [here for rest of the build info](null), but the full set of files is below, including the Fusion 360 CAD file. Thank you to all my supporters! More to come this summer!
